This is another weekend project for learning the mentality of Redux. I worked with some APIs to understand structure. My final thinking for Redux; was challenging but I loved it.

## What I Learn

- Redux (Slice Structure)
- i18n Usage in React (I was use many times in Vue. My first usage with React.)

## What Will Happen Next

- Adding BEM methodologies.
- Updating Components for Breakpoints.
